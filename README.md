### Your one-stop solution for agriculture automation, plant identification, and monitoring insights!

#### Overview:
The goal of this project is to create a system that automatically waters plants based on the soil moisture level and tracks the change in water usage over different seasons using temperature and humidity data. The project will use data science techniques to analyze the collected data and optimize the watering process for maximum plant growth and health. Additionally, an android app will be developed to display the data insights to the user, and a plant identifying classifier model will be added to assist smaller scale plant parents.
